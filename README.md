# officer-filing-web

CHS Web front end for officer filings:

1. TM01 Remove a director
2. AP01 Appoint a director
3. CH01 Update a director

This Node / Express / Typescript Web app sits in from of officer-filing-api and uses Nunjucks and the GOV.UK design toolkit to implement these three Web journeys.

## DISCLAIMER ***********************************************************************
Due to a problem with where GOV-UK Frontened looks for it's fonts, we have had to add an override
in styles.html.
The problem was that we are using the newer version of GOVUK-Frontend. Version 4.6.0.

This newer version looks for the fonts in a different place to the older versions, it looks for them 
in {cdnHost}/assets/fonts/{font name}

older versions look for it in {cdnHost}/fonts/{font name}. So because the older versions looked for it there,  
the cdn builder builds it and puts the fonts in that location, so when using the new GOV-UK Frontend,  
it doesnâ€™t find the fonts.

We have added an override to tell it to look in the /fonts location instead, this will fix the symptom, 
but not cure the problem, as any changes to the fonts urls in future GOV-UK Frontend releases, 
will mean it will stop working.
